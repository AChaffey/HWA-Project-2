# HWA-Project-2


This projects aim is to be able to create a functioning API with a working back and front end with a website that a user can interact with. This application will allow a user to input a song name, artist and release year, they will then be able to Create, Read, Update and Delete to the table.
The user should be able to achieve the above because of the coding completed in JAVA and the database created in MYSQL and the Front end created in HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
**Getting Started**
This application can be found on GitHub in the repository https://github.com/AChaffey/HWA-Project-2
**Prerequisites**
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
**Github:**
The first thing needed to be able to replicate this project would be an account on Github. Here you will be able to use your terminal create branches and push your code. this is not needed to be downloaded but instead an account needs to be created by going to (https://github.com/).
**GitBash:**
![Picture1- git bash new branches](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103578276/172339446-d04f31e9-464e-4696-9a72-8b7271e607e1.png)

To be able to do the above you can download git bash, this is a terminal like stated above where you can push your code to github.com. you can download git bash here (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
 
**MySQL:**
In order to be able to replicate the methods used in this application there are some software that needs to be downloaded and installed. First, we should start with MYSQL. Following this mysql link (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/8.0.html) should enable you to be able to download the application and enable you to install it on your device. - this download and installation will enable you to have the facilities to create databases and tables and more, it can also be linked with Java to utilised those databases you’ve created.

**Java:**
You will also need to download and install Java using this link (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) for Java windows however you can select the tab for macOS and Linux. Once you have downloaded it simply click on the downloaded file and follow the instructions- here you will be able to create the source code needed for applications, websites etc.
To use Java we need to download an IDE I used eclipse. This allows you to write the code that humans can read. If you follow this link you will be able to download uninstall eclipse (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
**Maven:**
Also for this application I used maven if you follow this link you'll be able to install and download moving for your PC/Laptop (https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
**Draw.io:**
One application you do not need to download or install however need to access online to create your ERD is (https://app.diagrams.net/) - this website gives you a large amount of resources to use in order to create what you need.
**Installing**
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running
Step 1- first you're going to need to install an IDE, I would recommend eclipse because of its ease as mentioned above there is a link where you can install and download it and once it is downloaded it should look like this.

Step 2- step two you going to go ahead and install Java. I have got version 16.
Step 3- next you are going to want to install maven. This will enable you to build your application once it is complete.
Step 4- for this you're going to want to go to github.com can you go into create an account
 
Step 5- ensure that you have Git also downloaded, remembering this is a terminal you use and GitHub is what stores your code I'm where you can push your code using repository’s you can create.

Step 6- once you have linked your GitHub with your terminal you can now go into eclipse and begin creating your first project.
Running the tests
You can test your application either after you finished or are you going. you will need to write the code for the testing and then you will need to run the unit testing on the file or on the folder in which you want to test. you can do this by right clicking going down to where it says run as and clicking unit testing.
If your test is passed you should find it looks like this.

step 7 - For this project youre going to utilise CSS, HTML and JavaScript, this will be the 'front end of your application, you can use the HTML to write the front page, then use CSS fro the styling and use JAvascript for functionality on the page.

**Deployment**
Read this application it must be maven packaged using SpringBoot. you can do this by opening up your git bash on your folder which you have linked with GitHub. you can then type the command “mvn clean package” on this will build your application. it is worth noting that if your build is unsuccessful this is likely to do with testing.
